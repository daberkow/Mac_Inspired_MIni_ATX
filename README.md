# Mac_Inspired_MIni_ATX

These pieces are Adobe Illuatrator files for a Classic Mac Inspired Mini Atx
case I built. It supports full height graphics cards, and has a cute front
 screen.

All the pieces are broken into their own files, "Concept.ai" is the original
tinkerings I had, those pieces sizes are not final, and should not be used.
